The voice of the fans: Analyzing Twitter data and generating headlines using transformers for the Dallas Mavericks Season


The use of social media platforms has become increasingly prevalent in capturing sentiment and opinions on various topics, including sports. In this report we present a comprehensive analysis of the tweets pertaining to the Dallas Mavericks 2021/2022 season, focusing on sentiment analysis and headline generation based on the extracted information. By leveraging the vast amount of user-generated content on Twitter, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the public’s perception on the team’s performance throughout the season.

The primary objective of this project was two-fold: 
- perform sentiment analysis on the collected tweets and to spot any weird thing if compared to the team results in the season
- utilize the extracted sentiment information to generate engaging and informative headlines for match summaries. Such insights can prove invaluable to media outlets, sports organizations and fans alike in understanding the overall reception of a team’s performance and crafting compelling narratives to engage with the audience.
